# Concept

30 Days will be a multiplayer top-down action-adventure game.
The controls and environment will feel Zelda-esque, with large 
regions loading at once and the viewport scrolling with the 
player's movements.  Each region should be capable of supporting
a decently large number of players, so that player interaction
occurs frequently, but there remains a strong need to explore and
develop your character independetly as well.  Combat happens in 
real-time, and the player may possess and use a number of active
(activates in response to a direct user-action) weapons and abilities and a  number of passive (activates in response to game event) weapons
or abilities.  Some of these items are consumable.  Weapons and items 
may also  be equipped to many slots on the player.  The player will
acquire various items by picking them up on the map or through 
trading with other players.

# Technical Considerations

* large regions
  * only a small subregion is displayed, but this area changes rapidly
* many players per region
* actions happen in real time
  * player moves
  * player picks up or drops items
  * player alters the environment
  * player uses a weapon, item, or ability
  * player equips items
  * player exits or enters the region
* there are a number of regions (50ish)
